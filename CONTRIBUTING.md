## How To Contribute
There are various ways to contribute to this project. Some may involve programming and others can be simple spelling corrections. Please feel free to open a pull request to add a new addon at any time.


### Reporting Issues
Found an issue with an addon, like incorrect definitions or a malfunctioning plugin? [Search for related issues](https://github.com/carsakiller/LLS-Addons/issues) to see if someone has already discovered the issue.

> **Note**
> It is important to look for already open issues as it keeps things organized and duplicate issues will be closed.

If your issue hasn't been reported already, [open up a new issue](https://github.com/carsakiller/LLS-Addons/issues/new/choose).


### Solving Issues
Take a look through the [open issues](https://github.com/carsakiller/LLS-Addons/issues) to see if there is one you are interested in solving. You can filter for [beginner-friendly issues](https://github.com/carsakiller/LLS-Addons/labels/beginner%20friendly) to find some of the easier issues that are great for getting started.


### Making Changes
Now that you have found/created an issue, we can learn how to contribute your solution.

1. Fork the repository to get your own copy of the project.
2. Create a branch where you can make your changes. Try to name the branch something related to what you are doing, e.g. `issue-58` or `busted-spelling`.
3. Commit your changes to your branch and confirm that things are working as expected.


### Testing Changes
Making sure that definitions are accurate is very important. Receiving help with testing changes is equally significant. There are too many libraries and frameworks for even a small team of people to test and have knowledge about.

To test changes from a pull request, you will have to clone that repository and checkout the branch being merged.

Once you have the changes locally on your computer, you can [test the changes with the Lua Language Server](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Libraries#link-to-workspace).
